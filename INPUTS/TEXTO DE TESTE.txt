TEXTO 1: 
Recently, I purchased a smartphone from brand X, and while the camera is excellent and takes amazing photos, the battery is very disappointing. Overall, I am pleased with the device's design, which is modern and lightweight, but the performance could be better, especially when running heavy applications. Additionally, the customer service was quite disappointing, as it took them days to respond to my inquiries. I expected a more efficient and pleasant experience.

TEXTO 2:
I recently stayed at a hotel in the city center, and my experience was a mix of highs and lows. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, always greeting me with a smile, which made me feel welcome. The room was spacious, but the cleanliness was not up to the mark, as I noticed dust in several corners. The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of options, but the coffee tasted burnt, which was disappointing. Overall, while the location was perfect for sightseeing, I expected a higher standard of service for the price I paid.
